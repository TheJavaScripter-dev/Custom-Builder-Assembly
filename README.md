🛠️ CBA: Advanced Framework for TurboWarp (JS Codebase)🧩 Custom Builders Assembly (CBA) Custom Builders Assembly (CBA) is a powerful, low-level extension framework for TurboWarp aimed at experienced developers. It bypasses common block programming limitations to enable the creation of complex systems, dynamic interpreters, virtual machines, and advanced data structures within the Scratch environment.⚠️ Security Warning & Target AudienceREAD BEFORE USE This extension is NOT SANDBOXED. It grants full, unrestricted access to the project's JavaScript environment.Use ONLY from trusted sources.Target Audience: Developers with a strong understanding of JavaScript and advanced programming concepts who accept the risks associated with non-sandboxed extensions.✨ Core Features for Developers CBA provides a foundational set of tools necessary for meta-programming and dynamic code execution:Centralized Storage (this.STORAGE):A single JavaScript object used by all blocks to manage advanced data, keeping it separate from standard Scratch lists and variables.Properties: Manages vars, buffers, lambdas, functions, and customBlocks.First-Class Functions (Lambdas):Allows the creation and execution of anonymous functions (lambdas) as dynamic values, enabling functional programming patterns.Low-Level Data Management:Direct block access to create, manipulate, and utilize binary buffers (buffers) for high-performance data processing or custom encoding/decoding.Dynamic Function Definition:Blocks for defining, storing, and executing user-defined functions and procedures dynamically at runtime.🚀 Getting Started (Installation)Download the Extension:Download the main extension file: CBAext.jsLoad into TurboWarp:Open the TurboWarp Editor.Click "Add Extension".Select "Load from File" (or URL, if you host it elsewhere) and select CBAext.js.The CBA blocks will appear in your palette.💡 Example: Dynamic Function Call(Placeholder for Visual Content: Insert a GIF or image of a block script here!)Show an example where a function is defined, stored in this.STORAGE.functions, and then executed later by another block. This visually proves the power of the framework.ConceptBlock FunctionalityDEFINEBlock to define a new function body in this.STORAGE.functions.EXECUTEBlock to call the stored function name dynamically.🤝 Contribution & LicenseThis project is open-source under the GPL-3.0 License.If you find this framework useful for your advanced TurboWarp projects:Star the Repository! ⭐Open an Issue to report bugs or suggest new complex features.
